There are pre-trained models in the models folder. Running `python3 report-clfrs.py` will produce a report containing the test-train-val accuracy, proof statistics, and hyper-parameters/grid for each pre-trained model. This command should be piped to a file for more readibility. The file `out` already contains the result of running this command on the pre-trained models.

If you wish to retrain the models, you can do so by running `python3 mkclfrs.py`. This will take some time to complete. These models will overwrite the pretrained models in the models folder. Checkout the repo to reobtain the pre-trained models.

The neural net architecture and test train loops are coded in nets.py, which is imported by mkclfrs.py. In the figs folder are the graphs of accuracy and loss wrt epoch.

The data is processed in the dat.py module, which is imported by mkclfrs.py.
